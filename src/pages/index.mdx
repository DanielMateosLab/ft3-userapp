# User Auth Web App

Here is my website submission for the Fathom3 frontend developer test.

- I have developed a straightforward user authentication web app that permits users to sign up, log in, and log out. The app also features a dashboard page, accessible exclusively to logged-in users.
- Given the time constraints, I prioritized code quality and testing, employing both Test Driven Development and Component Driven Development methodologies.
- For the project, I utilized Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Storybook was employed for organizing the components. Testing was carried out using Jest and the React Testing Library.
- Since I am applying for a frontend position, I incorporated a mock backend to save user data in memory. Although I used the API routes provided by Next.js to create the backend, the endpoints are relatively simple and don't reflect a real backend's complexity.
- Lastly, to log in with a pre-existing user, you may use the account detailed in `/home/dani/personal/employees-crud/src/server/data.ts`. Here are the credentials (or alternatively, you can create a new account):
  - Email: `hi@jhondoe.com`
  - Password: `Jhondoe1111`

## Requirements to run the project

- Node.js installed on your system.
- An installed package manager, npm or yarn.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of this project.
3. Install the dependencies by running one of the following commands: (if using yarn, you might want to delete the `package-lock.json` file first)

   With npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   With yarn:

   ```
   yarn install

## Running the Web App

To start the web app, run one of the following commands:

With npm:

```
npm run build && npm start
```

With yarn:

```
yarn build && yarn start
```

This will start the application in production mode. To run in development mode, just execute `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

## Running the Tests

To run all the tests in a one-time mode:

With npm:

```
npm run test-once
```

With yarn:

```
yarn test-once
```

## Running storybook to view the components
